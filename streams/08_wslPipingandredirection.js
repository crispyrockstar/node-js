/* use of streams along with different process running in the systems

example:

we can take input from the user using process.stdin and read this and use the inputs and 
process this data in js file and write the output to process.stdout and now this output stream can be use to pipe the data to another process using | operator in the terminal(Linux)


like using spawn from child process we can spawn another process and pipe the output of the current process to the input of the spawned process
example: output of js file can be used to open a tab in the chrome browser

now there can be million combinations depending on the requirement
and flow how to design

some automation tools those similar kind of things to automate the process
example: zapier, ifttt
